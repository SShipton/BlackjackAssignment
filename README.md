<p align="center">In this game of Blackjack, you are automatically dealt two cards. The cards are added up for you, and you are given a total, and a choice: hit, or stand? If you hit, another card will be drawn. If your total is below 21, you will be given the aforementioned choice. If your total is above 21, you'll bust, and the House will automatically win. If you stand, House will hit until their amount is higher than yours, or until they bust.</p>
